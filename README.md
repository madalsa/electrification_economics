# Electrification Economics

Personal economics of residential electrification in California: how rate
design, system sizing, VMT, and incentives change payback and NPV for
PV + storage + EV + heat pump adoption.

Built on top of the `california_rates` rate-design and bill-calculation
pipelines (PGE / SCE / SDGE).

## Research questions

1. Under which rate designs is electrification (any combination of EV,
   PV+storage, heat pump) economically attractive for which customers?
2. What is the *optimal* PV+storage size by customer × rate × climate zone,
   and how sensitive is NPV to deviation from optimum?
3. How do annual VMT and gasoline price change EV + whole-home payback?
4. Which lever — rate design, sizing, incentives, fuel price, or load shape
   — moves payback the most?

## Scope

- **Utilities:** PGE, SCE, SDGE (reuse pipeline outputs).
- **Rate designs:** ~15-20 (existing 8 + fixed-charge variants, demand
  charges, EV-only TOU, NEM 2.0 / NBT / full-retail export, dynamic-pricing
  proxy).
- **Tech bundles:** EV, PV+storage, PV+EV+storage, heat pump (Upgrade 11),
  full electrification.
- **Sensitivities:** PV kW, battery kWh, VMT, gasoline price, gas price
  trajectory, IRA/SGIP/TECH incentive levels, discount rate, financing.
- **Buildings:** representative sample (target ~1,500 medoids from
  stratified k-means clustering) with population weights; full-population
  validation on a subset. Clustering features include both *volume*
  (annual_kwh, peak_kw, sqft, therms) and *shape* (cooling/heating/
  hot-water/plug-loads end-use shares, summer/winter peakiness =
  peak_kw / mean_kw) so archetypes differentiate on the load timing
  patterns that drive rate-design sensitivity.

## Read / write contract with parent `california_rates/`

EE is strictly **read-only** with respect to anything outside its own
`data/` folder. Specifically:

- **Reads** parent files (`CA_baseline_*.parquet`, `rate_scenarios_*.csv`,
  `tou_weights_*.csv`, `eec_hourly_2025.csv`, `Baseline_<u>/*.parquet`,
  etc.) via `pd.read_parquet` / `pd.read_csv` — never mutated.
- **Writes** only to `electrification_economics/data/`. A guard in
  `config.assert_safe_out_dir()` refuses any `--out-dir` argument that
  resolves outside that folder, so a typo can't overwrite parent outputs
  or a symlinked shared-storage `Baseline_*/` alias.
- Parent modules (`<utility>_battery_lp`, `<utility>_solar`, ...) are
  imported only from `sizing_optimizer_hourly.py` and only their
  function definitions are used — their `__main__` blocks are not
  executed.

`tests/test_safety_guards.py` enforces these properties.

## Status

Scaffold only. See each `src/*.py` for design notes and TODOs.

## Moving to a standalone repo later

When ready:

```bash
# In this repo:
git subtree split --prefix=electrification_economics -b ee-extract
# Push that branch to a new GitHub repo as `main`.
```
